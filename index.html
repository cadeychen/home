<h1>plot</h1>
<p>This story was taken place in an August in the late 1930s. Eight people with different identities arrived on an isolated island off the Devon coast of 
England. They were invited here by Mr.Ulick Norman Owen and Mrs.Una Nancy Owen for different reasons. The Owens had not arrived. In the meantime the guests 
discovered that a framed copy of a nursery rhyme Ten little Soilders hangs in every bedroom and on the dinning table there were ten figurines of little 
soilders.After the guasts had supper, a gramophone record played. The content accused every visitor of commiting a murder but had escaped from being 
punished.The guests then realized that none of then actually knew the Owens and their names stands for unknown. When they were finished with the record,
one of the guests, Anthony Marston dies from cyanide poisoning after he finishes his drink.The rest of the guests discovered that one figurine was broken.
The way that they die can be linked to the rhyme Ten little Soilders.The death of the visitors continues as time pass.The rest of the guests explored the 
island and concluded that no one else could possibly be here and they are trapped.The figurines broke one after another as people dies.When there were
only one person-Vera Elizabeth Claythorne left, she commited suicide. But later as Scotland Yard officials were investigating this case, they found evidence
that someone was still alive after Vera killed herself. So the killer unknown must be one of the eight visitors.</p>
<h1>The killer</h1>
<p>The killer was Mr.Lawrence Wragrave. He was a judge known as a hanging judge for liberty awarding the death penalty. But he has a lifelong sadistic urge 
to cause death and a lifelong wish to create a masterpiece of a mystery. But since he decided only to indulge it with guilty persons. After finding himself
terminally ill, he creates a game as Mr.U.K.Owen and invites people from different classes who all had been guilty for the death of someone else. He designed 
the game so it seems like that there's always one or more survivor after each death. So it will become an unsolvable mystery. Mr.Wargrave left three evidence
that points to the murderer. But he thinks that the detectives still cannot figure out who was the killer.He wrote a confession("a pitiful human need" as he 
discribed) and threw that into the sea before he killed himself as he arranged.

<h1>impacts</h1>
<p>And then there were none ws first published in Great Britain and the United States in 1939. At first the English edition was called "Ten little Niggers".
But the word "nigger" was considered offensive in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.So the book was renamed as "And then there were none"
(the last five words of the the nursery rhyme"ten little soilders")
for its American edition.This book was widely considered a masterpiece and Agatha Christie herself said that this was the most diffcult book that she had ever
wrote. The major plot point of this book is British blackface song "ten little soilders"(or"ten little niggers") which tells the reader the fate of the characters.
And then there were none is one of the best-selling books of all time , it is the world's best-selling mystery book and Agatha Christie's best selling book, 
with more than 100 million copies sold globally. The book has been translated into over 50 languages other than English. The plot itself has appeared in many 
shows around the world involving crime in the memory of Agatha Christie. </p>

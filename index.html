<img src="and thre is a beautiful view of the island.jpg" width="690" length="450" alt="A view of the island which the story is taking place"/>
<p>This story was taken place in an August in the late 1930s. Eight people with different identities arrived on an isolated island off the Devon
coast of England. They were invited here by Mr. Ulick Norman Owen and Mrs. Una Nancy Owen for different reasons. The Owens had not arrived. At the 
meantime, the guests discovered that a framed copy of a nursery rhyme Ten little soldiers&#40or &lsquo;Ten Little Indians &rsquo;&#41 hangs in every bedroom and on the dinning table there were
ten figurines of little soldiers.</p>
<p>After the guests had supper, a gramophone record played. The content accused every visitor of committing a murder but had escaped from being punished.
The guests then realized that none of then actually knew the Owens and their names stands for &ldquo; unknown &rdquo;. When they were finished with the record, one of
the guests, Anthony Marston dies from cyanide poisoning after he finishes his drink. The rest of the guests discovered that one figurine was broken. 
The death of the visitors continues as time pass.The way that they die can be linked to the rhyme Ten Little Soldiers.The rest of the guests explored the 
island and concluded that no one else could possibly be here and they are trapped. The figurines broke one after another as people dies. When there were only
one person-Vera Elizabeth Claythorne left, she committed suicide. But later as Scotland Yard officials were investigating this case, they found evidence that
someone was still alive after Vera killed herself. So the killer unknown must be one of the eight visitors.</p>

<img src="a blue killer i guess.jpg" width="690" length="520" alt="The Killer"/>
<p>The killer was Mr.Lawrence Wragrave. He was known as a &ldquo; hanging judge&rdquo; for liberty awarding the death penalty. But he has a lifelong sadistic urge 
to cause death and a lifelong wish to create a masterpiece of mystery. But he decided only to indulge it with guilty persons. After finding himself
terminally ill, he creates a game as Mr.Ulick.Norman.Owen and invites people from different classes who all had been guilty for the death of someone else. He designed 
the game so it seems like that there's always one or more survivor after each death. So it will become an unsolvable mystery. Mr.Wargrave left three evidence
that points to the murderer. But he thinks that the detectives still cannot figure out who was the killer.He wrote a confession& &#40 &ldquo;a pitiful human need&rdquo; as he 
discribed &#41 and threw that into the sea before he killed himself as he arranged.
